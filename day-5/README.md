# React Fundamentals - Day 5

## Overview

In the fifth and final day of this course, students learn development patterns for composing complex stateful components. Students are introduced centralized state practices through Redux and and learn to compose reducers actions to edit the data store. The class concludes with a brief explanation of `react-scripts` and a simple deployment exercise, as well as dedicated time to answer lingering questions from throughout the course content. 

## Learning Objectives

* Recognize the use case for centralized state management through Redux 
* Understand how to implement TypeScript into new and existing React apps configured with create-react-app
* Identify and explain advanced component development patterns and practices

## Suggested Pacing

This is a *rough* estimation on how long to spend on topics, but will be adjusted to the needs of the classroom!
