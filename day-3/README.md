# React Fundamentals - Day 3

## Overview

In the third day of this course, students continue expanding their understanding of building React applications, being introduced to storing arrays in state and displaying them as lists of data on the page. Students learn about the Component Lifecycle and Lifecycle methods.

## Learning Objectives

* Explain the React Component Lifecycle and how to implement side effects to changes in application state
* Understand how to fetch data from an API and display it on the page
* Utilize React Router to add front end routing to a single page React application

## Suggested Pacing

This is a *rough* estimation on how long to spend on topics, but will be adjusted to the needs of the classroom!
