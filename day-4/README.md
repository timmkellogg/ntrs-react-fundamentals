# React Fundamentals - Day 4

## Overview

In the fourth day of this course, students learn to utilize React Hooks to build stateful components without using React Classes. Students then learn to utilize the React Router library to handle front-end routing in their Single Page Applications. 

## Learning Objectives

* Explain what React Hooks are and the motivation for their adoption
* Understand how to convert a class component to a functional component using hooks
* Describe the purpose and use of the most commonly used hooks

## Suggested Pacing

This is a *rough* estimation on how long to spend on topics, but will be adjusted to the needs of the classroom!
